This is the WinTTY terminal emulator for Microsoft Windows.

Compile
=======
WinTTY compiles using MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.

Building with MinGW
-------------------
Simply run "make". The resulting executable ("wintty.exe") should appear
in the root of the working directory.

Building with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
------------------------------------------
Open vcbuild/wintty.sln, and select "Build" -> "Build Solution" from the
menu. The resulting executable ("wintty.exe") should appear in
./vcbuild/Debug for Debug builds, or ./vcbuild/Release for Release builds.

Usage
=====
run "wintty.exe %COMSPEC%" to run from cmd.exe, or "wintty.exe /bin/sh"
to run from the msys environment. Both command launches a new shell of
the same type as the shell it was invoked from.
